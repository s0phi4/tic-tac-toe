- Development process - A true story!

  - Lost in space: Once I saw the assignment, I had a hard time structuring a work flow. I first worked on the HTML and was trying to get the board and things printed on the screen. I knew I had to work on my functions but was afraid to start because I had no clear direction and javascript scared me.

  - A small light: A diagram of a work flow designed by one of our instructors, helped me create my own. So, hands on pen and paper and started writing down the logic to create the game. I also decided to defeat the fear and make js my friend :)
  Here is the logic:

      -Create a js file and set the variables needed (Board and players)
      -Functions needed: Turns
                         Winning sets - Not DRY
                         Reset game
                         Disable turns when a winning set is true.
      -Console.log most of the sections in the functions to test them.

  - Again in the dark: Many of the functions I created were not working at first, because I was not structuring them correctly; for instance, I had no return on some of them when it was a must, I was also not referencing the correct variables. So, I gave up on my self-sufficiency and reached out to the other developers in my cohort.

  - Many lights in the tunnel: After reaching out, talking out my logic, showing my code, listening to others, and seeing their logic, I was able to think code in a more ample way, meaning being more specific, detailed, and organized when writing code so the computer gets my intentions...Everyone was very helpful and kind!

  - Trapping HTML: After hourly sessions of writing, testing, deleting, changing...it was time to witness my work on the screen. so localhost came in the picture. Nothing happened, just some plain ugly board, forms, and board. Bootstrap was the solution for it to look decent, I chose to trap my HTML in a jumbotron and in some modal forms. I am using the term trap because after many trials jumbotron rejected my style effects;therefore my page is trapped in a default jumbotron.

  - A love for jquery: I fell in love! Building jquery functions and adding different methods, callbacks, and jquery returns.

  - Ready for the next tunnel: I encountered many problems with JS, I still can't say it is my friend, but I can work with it. Throughout this project I developed a better way of approaching coding problems and got my hands to type and my mind to break into code.


- Unsolved problems

- I believe my winning function could be actually changed into a helper function and using it as a callback.
- Avoid jumbotron.
